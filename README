Epic Audio README

EA is (will be) a multi-threaded socket-based audio player allowing
control from any language or client that supports sockets (and any
number of clients) along with the ability to play files from anywhere
on the filesystem and one day in many different formats.

That's someday.  It's still heavily in development.  Don't use it.
